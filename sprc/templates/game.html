        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Made by the creators of Clash Of Clans and Clash Royle, we present you -
            Brawl
            stars! A new free
            multiplayer Action game on iOS and Android. The game itself has an option to play in team or alone.
            You
            can also choose
            from a couple of game modes. All of the game modes and maps are changed very often so you might need
            to
            try out differnet brawlers
            on differnet maps. You can also get new brawlers by collecting trophies or unlocking them in the
            boxes.
            There are different rarities
            of the brawlers which makes it more difficult to get all of the fighters in a few boxes. After some
            time
            you will be able to
            upgrade your favorite brawlers with the tokens you collect. We wish you good luck with those boxes!
